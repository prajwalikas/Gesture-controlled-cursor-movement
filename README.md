# Gesture-controlled-cursor-movement
This project allows you to control your mouse cursor using hand gestures detected through a webcam. It uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, pyautogui, and pynput to track hand movements and simulate mouse actions.

# Description
The application captures real-time video from your webcam, detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, and maps finger positions to cursor movement. A pinch gesture (thumb and index finger together) is used to simulate a mouse click.

# Technologies Used
MediaPipe for hand tracking

OpenCV for video capture

pyautogui for cursor control

pynput for simulating mouse clicks

# Notes
Works best in good lighting

Hand should be clearly visible to the camera

Can be extended to include more gestures like scroll or right-click
